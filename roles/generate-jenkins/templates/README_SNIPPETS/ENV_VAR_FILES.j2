## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__MYVAR=/run/secrets/mysecretvariable
```

Will set the environment variable `MYVAR` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretvariable` file.
